###About the dataset:
Data comes from 3 penguin species in the islands of Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. The data was collected as part of research to study Antarctic penguins’ foraging behavior and its relationship with environmental variability. Data was originally listed as three separate datasets within the Palmer Station Long-Term Ecological Research (PAL-LTER) data system. Each of these separate datasets corresponds to one of the three species of penguin: Adélie (152 penguins), Gentoo (124 penguins), and Chinstrap (68 penguins). They were combined into the single Palmer penguins dataset (152+124+68 = 344 penguins).

###Task:
Introduction to the manual process of managing machine learning experiments by conducting experiments using multiple models and tracking results using standardized evaluation metrics.
